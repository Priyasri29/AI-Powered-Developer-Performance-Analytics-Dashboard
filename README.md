# AI-Powered Developer Performance Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Developer Performance Analytics Dashboard** is an interactive tool designed to analyze and visualize developer performance based on data collected from a GitHub repository. It provides performance insights such as commit frequency, PR merge rate, and issue resolution time, with support for natural language queries powered by the Groq LLaMA API.

## Features

- **Developer Performance Metrics**: Analyze developer activity, including commits, pull requests, and issue resolution.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualize metrics through charts and graphs for better performance understanding.
- **Natural Language Query Interface**: Retrieve insights and metrics using natural language questions, powered by the Groq LLaMA API.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- GitHub Personal Access Token for accessing GitHub API
- Groq LLaMA API token for natural language processing

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/developer-performance-dashboard.git
   cd developer-performance-dashboard
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file with the following structure:

   ```env
   GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_personal_access_token>
   GROQ_LLAMA_TOKEN=<your_groq_llama_api_token>
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit dashboard:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   The dashboard will launch on your local server, allowing you to interact with the performance metrics and use the natural language query interface.

## Usage

1. **Select a GitHub Repository**: Input the URL of a GitHub repository to fetch data such as commits, pull requests, and issues.
2. **View Performance Metrics**: The dashboard will display interactive visualizations for developer performance metrics like commit frequency, PR merge rate, and issue resolution time.
3. **Ask Questions**: Use the natural language query field to retrieve insights by typing queries such as "What is the PR merge rate?"

## Key Metrics

- **Commit Frequency**: Measures how frequently commits are made over time.
- **PR Merge Rate**: Percentage of pull requests merged.
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Average time taken to resolve issues.
- **Code Review Participation**: Tracks developer involvement in code reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive dashboard.
- **PyGithub**: To fetch GitHub repository data.
- **Plotly**: For generating interactive visualizations.
- **Groq LLaMA API**: For handling natural language queries.

## Conclusion

The AI-Powered Developer Performance Analytics Dashboard offers a powerful, interactive way to monitor and assess developer productivity. Its combination of interactive charts, metrics, and natural language query support makes it a valuable tool for project managers, team leads, and developers looking to improve performance insights.
